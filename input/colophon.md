### I made this website myself, which isn't exactly an efficient choice, but
It's a choice I'm happy with. I have no doubt it's related to my too many interests that I can't avoid. I've eventually learned to softly embrace that. It's rewarding too to hand make things. But those aren't the only reasons.

#### What else?
- Wanting something simple that I *know* is simple
	- It is absurdly common that a website minimal and modern and not too complicated at all but will be full of clutter behind the scenes. I think that's just simply *wrong*. It feels like bad faith to me and against the nature of a good design.
- Understanding how it's made, why, and how to control it
- Following the KISS principle
	- Keep it Simple Stupid, or Keep it Stupid Simple. I think it's a great principle to follow, and either flavour is useful.
- Save some money
	- Webflow costs 12 - 36USD
	- There are some other options out there but as far as ease of use and control, none seem to make any more sense than Webflow. It's definitely possible to get something cheap that's premade and connected to a good CMS but that'd lack a whole lot of personality which seems a bit redundant for a personal website.

## This site is made with
- 11ty for a static site generator, because it's somehow minimalist and maximalist which I resonate with. It's very minimal but very flexible and allows for use of more templating languages than any other options. Other options are cluttered and less flexible.
- Nunjucks, because it's readable and quick to figure out in a simple way. Others are simpler but there's something nice about good documentation and a higher ceiling of potential use.
	- I liked Pug when I was looking at different options but then I found some of it not quickly grokkable. This doesn't mean that it's bad in a general sense. It's just bad for my use case. For this I needed something that I could implement quickly and have a minimum effective dose quickly.
- Typeset with [Overpass](https://overpassfont.org) and [Alegreya](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro). Both are hosted on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). I've loved Overpass for quite some time and found it some point before it was ever on Google. Alegreya was chosen after getting lost one evening comparing a variety of well made fonts all night into the early morning.
	- As much as I do love these two fonts, eventually I intend to switch to [Mrs Eaves](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves) for all body copy when I can afford to buy it. It is quite simply my favourite font. There's something about it that I eventually hope I can put better words too.
